        during the template construction, when the breath similarity measure B(Xi, T, V, S) is computed for each of the
        examples. The minimum value of the similarity measures between each of the examples and the template is determined, 
        denoted by Bm. The threshold is set to Bm / 2. The logic behind this setting is that the frame-to-template
        similarity of breath sounds in general is expected to be somewhat lower than the similarity among examples used to
        construct the template in the first place. This parameter is referred as "bsmThreshold".
        2) The energy is below a given threshold, which is chosen to be below the average energy of voiced speech (see
        Section III-A). This parameter is referred as "engThreshold".
        3) The zero-crossing rate is below a given threshold. Experimental data have shown that ZCR above 0.25 (assuming
        a sampling rate of 44 kHz) is exhibited only by a number of unvoiced fricatives, and breath sounds have much lower
        ZCR (see Section III-A). This parameter is referred as "zcrThreshold".
        Following the initial detection, a binary breathiness index is assigned to each frame: breathy frames are assigned
        index 1, whereas nonbreathy frames are assigned index 0.
